This project is an engaging, bare-bones game of guessing. You, as the player, must guess what the letter (a-z) the computer is thinking of. Every round, the computer chooses a new letter. You have nine chances to guess the letter. You gain a "win" if you guess correctly and tally a "lose" if you do not. Pick carefully, this is high-stakes!
