## What this project does
>Tired of looking for awesome GIFs by typing them into Google, going to images, and picking out your favorite one? Me too! Now, you can use this webpage to get more GIFs than you dream of with just the press of a button.

This project gives the user a multitude of gifs under a certain tagline. The user is able to get images of animals via the buttons, but in reality the user can enter ANY topic they want into the "Add an Animal" search bar. What is more, this project is intelligent because it avoids the gifs all auto-playing annoyingly; rather, the user can play a gif by clicking it and stop it with another click. The gifs are stopped by default.

## How users can get started with the project
