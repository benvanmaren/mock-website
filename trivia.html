    NOTE: If every answer is chosen correctly, then the game works perfectly EXCEPT the timer
    does not stop when the Game Over screen is up.
    The game is buggy when an anser is chosen INcorrectly.
    
    
    If I could do this again, I would do it differently. At the time when I made this,
I tried making dynamic elements for my questions but it became complicated and troublesome.
I would make a for loop that would dymamically create divs (or another element) for each
Question and Answer set. Each Answer div would be set an attribute via .attr equal to 
the Answer itself. The Array of questions and answers would have a "Correct Answer" Array
element (not included here) that would indicate the correct answer. 

Thus, if (attr === Correct Answer), then wins++ and next for loop iternation.
If not equal, then losses++ and next for lopp interation.

I would also make it so I only have one click fuction. It would be wound into the Correct 
Answer check above.

My timer would also be fixed, something that I think would be a LOT easier to fix if I made
the above changes because my entire code would not be as clunky.

I am looking forward to making these changes when I have time :)  -->
