## What this project does
>Imagine this: your whole, wonderful day depends on you taking a certain train. The train station doesn't have clear information on next arrivals, how many minutes away, etc. So what do you do? Don't to the math in your head! Just enter your train info and everything you need to know will be at your fingertips.

This project calculates and displays different aspects about an upcoming train arrival based off minimal information that a user enters. It seamlessly converts information into a readable format. What is more, all user entries are displayed in a simple, stream-lined table, even across multiple devices. Therefore, if a user enters information and wants to return to it later, they are very able to do that.

## Why the project is useful

Trains are very confusing! Many movies have been made about this--so it's a fact (without any alternative facts). This project makes trains a lot less confusing by taking the guess work out of their arrival information and effortlessly helping a user make their departure.
