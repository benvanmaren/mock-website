This project is an exciting game with each round starting on a new slate. You are given four crystals, each worth some unknown amount of points. It's your job to add the correct amounts of each crystal so you get exactly the Total Points. If you get too many points (by clicking the wrong crystals), you lose! Worry not though, if you lose you always have next round to try again. Essentially, you need to figure out the value of each crystal *as* you are playing the game.
